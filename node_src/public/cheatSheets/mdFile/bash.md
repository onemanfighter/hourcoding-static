## Introduction

This is a quick reference to getting started with Bash scripting.

- [Learn bash in y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/bash/) _(learnxinyminutes.com)_
- [Bash Guide](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide) _(mywiki.wooledge.org)_
- [Bash Hackers Wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20230406205817/https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/) _(wiki.bash-hackers.org)_

### Example

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

name="John"
echo "Hello $name!"
```

### Variables

```bash
name="John"
echo $name  # see below
echo "$name"
echo "${name}!"
```

Generally quote your variables unless they contain wildcards to expand or command fragments.

```bash
wildcard="*.txt"
options="iv"
cp -$options $wildcard /tmp
```

### String quotes

```bash
name="John"
echo "Hi $name"  #=> Hi John
echo 'Hi $name'  #=> Hi $name
```

### Shell execution

```bash
echo "I'm in $(pwd)"
echo "I'm in `pwd`"  # obsolescent
# Same
```

See [Command substitution](https://web.archive.org/web/20230326081741/https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/expansion/cmdsubst)

### Conditional execution

```bash
git commit && git push
git commit || echo "Commit failed"
```

### Functions

{: id='functions-example'}

```bash
get_name() {
  echo "John"
}

echo "You are $(get_name)"
```

See: [Functions](#functions)

### Conditionals

{: id='conditionals-example'}

```bash
if [[ -z "$string" ]]; then
  echo "String is empty"
elif [[ -n "$string" ]]; then
  echo "String is not empty"
fi
```

See: [Conditionals](#conditionals)

### Strict mode

```bash
set -euo pipefail
IFS=$'\n\t'
```

See: [Unofficial bash strict mode](http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/)

### Brace expansion

```bash
echo {A,B}.js
```

| Expression                        | Description           |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `{A,B}`                           | Same as `A B`         |
| `{A,B}.js`                        | Same as `A.js B.js`   |
| `{1..5}`                          | Same as `1 2 3 4 5`   |
| <code>&lcub;{1..3},{7..9}}</code> | Same as `1 2 3 7 8 9` |

See: [Brace expansion](https://web.archive.org/web/20230207192110/https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/expansion/brace)

## Parameter expansions

{: .-three-column}

### Basics

```bash
name="John"
echo "${name}"
echo "${name/J/j}"    #=> "john" (substitution)
echo "${name:0:2}"    #=> "Jo" (slicing)
echo "${name::2}"     #=> "Jo" (slicing)
echo "${name::-1}"    #=> "Joh" (slicing)
echo "${name:(-1)}"   #=> "n" (slicing from right)
echo "${name:(-2):1}" #=> "h" (slicing from right)
echo "${food:-Cake}"  #=> $food or "Cake"
```

```bash
length=2
echo "${name:0:length}"  #=> "Jo"
```

See: [Parameter expansion](https://web.archive.org/web/20230408142504/https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe)

```bash
str="/path/to/foo.cpp"
echo "${str%.cpp}"    # /path/to/foo
echo "${str%.cpp}.o"  # /path/to/foo.o
echo "${str%/*}"      # /path/to

echo "${str##*.}"     # cpp (extension)
echo "${str##*/}"     # foo.cpp (basepath)

echo "${str#*/}"      # path/to/foo.cpp
echo "${str##*/}"     # foo.cpp

echo "${str/foo/bar}" # /path/to/bar.cpp
```

```bash
str="Hello world"
echo "${str:6:5}"   # "world"
echo "${str: -5:5}"  # "world"
```

```bash
src="/path/to/foo.cpp"
base=${src##*/}   #=> "foo.cpp" (basepath)
dir=${src%$base}  #=> "/path/to/" (dirpath)
```

### Substitution

| Code              | Description         |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| `${foo%suffix}`   | Remove suffix       |
| `${foo#prefix}`   | Remove prefix       |
| ---               | ---                 |
| `${foo%%suffix}`  | Remove long suffix  |
| `${foo/%suffix}`  | Remove long suffix  |
| `${foo##prefix}`  | Remove long prefix  |
| `${foo/#prefix}`  | Remove long prefix  |
| ---               | ---                 |
| `${foo/from/to}`  | Replace first match |
| `${foo//from/to}` | Replace all         |
| ---               | ---                 |
| `${foo/%from/to}` | Replace suffix      |
| `${foo/#from/to}` | Replace prefix      |

### Comments

```bash
# Single line comment
```

```bash
: '
This is a
multi line
comment
'
```

### Substrings

| Expression      | Description                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `${foo:0:3}`    | Substring _(position, length)_ |
| `${foo:(-3):3}` | Substring from the right       |

### Length

| Expression | Description      |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| `${#foo}`  | Length of `$foo` |

### Manipulation

```bash
str="HELLO WORLD!"
echo "${str,}"   #=> "hELLO WORLD!" (lowercase 1st letter)
echo "${str,,}"  #=> "hello world!" (all lowercase)

str="hello world!"
echo "${str^}"   #=> "Hello world!" (uppercase 1st letter)
echo "${str^^}"  #=> "HELLO WORLD!" (all uppercase)
```

### Default values

| Expression        | Description                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `${foo:-val}`     | `$foo`, or `val` if unset (or null)                      |
| `${foo:=val}`     | Set `$foo` to `val` if unset (or null)                   |
| `${foo:+val}`     | `val` if `$foo` is set (and not null)                    |
| `${foo:?message}` | Show error message and exit if `$foo` is unset (or null) |

Omitting the `:` removes the (non)nullity checks, e.g. `${foo-val}` expands to `val` if unset otherwise `$foo`.

## Loops

{: .-three-column}

### Basic for loop

```bash
for i in /etc/rc.*; do
  echo "$i"
done
```

### C-like for loop

```bash
for ((i = 0 ; i < 100 ; i++)); do
  echo "$i"
done
```

### Ranges

```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Welcome $i"
done
```

#### With step size

```bash
for i in {5..50..5}; do
    echo "Welcome $i"
done
```

### Reading lines

```bash
while read -r line; do
  echo "$line"
done <file.txt
```

### Forever

```bash
while true; do
  ···
done
```

## Functions

{: .-three-column}

### Defining functions

```bash
myfunc() {
    echo "hello $1"
}
```

```bash
# Same as above (alternate syntax)
function myfunc() {
    echo "hello $1"
}
```

```bash
myfunc "John"
```

### Returning values

```bash
myfunc() {
    local myresult='some value'
    echo "$myresult"
}
```

```bash
result=$(myfunc)
```

### Raising errors

```bash
myfunc() {
  return 1
}
```

```bash
if myfunc; then
  echo "success"
else
  echo "failure"
fi
```

### Arguments

| Expression | Description                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `$#`       | Number of arguments                            |
| `$*`       | All positional arguments (as a single word)    |
| `$@`       | All positional arguments (as separate strings) |
| `$1`       | First argument                                 |
| `$_`       | Last argument of the previous command          |

**Note**: `$@` and `$*` must be quoted in order to perform as described.
Otherwise, they do exactly the same thing (arguments as separate strings).

See [Special parameters](https://web.archive.org/web/20230318164746/https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/shellvars#special_parameters_and_shell_variables).

## Conditionals

{: .-three-column}

### Conditions

Note that `[[` is actually a command/program that returns either `0` (true) or `1` (false). Any program that obeys the same logic (like all base utils, such as `grep(1)` or `ping(1)`) can be used as condition, see examples.

| Condition                | Description           |

| `[[ X                |                          | Y ]]` | Or  |

### File conditions

| Condition               | Description             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `[[ -e FILE ]]`         | Exists                  |
| `[[ -r FILE ]]`         | Readable                |
| `[[ -h FILE ]]`         | Symlink                 |

### Example

```bash
# String
if [[ -z "$string" ]]; then
  echo "String is empty"
elif [[ -n "$string" ]]; then
  echo "String is not empty"
else
  echo "This never happens"
fi
```

```bash
# Combinations
if [[ X && Y ]]; then
  ...
fi
```

```bash
# Equal
if [[ "$A" == "$B" ]]
```

```bash
# Regex
if [[ "A" =~ . ]]
```

```bash
if (( $a < $b )); then
   echo "$a is smaller than $b"
fi
```

```bash
if [[ -e "file.txt" ]]; then
  echo "file exists"
fi
```

## Arrays

### Defining arrays

```bash
Fruits=('Apple' 'Banana' 'Orange')
```

```bash
Fruits[0]="Apple"
Fruits[1]="Banana"
Fruits[2]="Orange"
```

### Working with arrays

```bash
echo "${Fruits[0]}"           # Element #0
echo "${Fruits[-1]}"          # Last element
echo "${Fruits[@]}"           # All elements, space-separated
echo "${#Fruits[@]}"          # Number of elements
echo "${#Fruits}"             # String length of the 1st element
echo "${#Fruits[3]}"          # String length of the Nth element
echo "${Fruits[@]:3:2}"       # Range (from position 3, length 2)
echo "${!Fruits[@]}"          # Keys of all elements, space-separated
```

### Operations

```bash
Fruits=("${Fruits[@]}" "Watermelon")    # Push
Fruits+=('Watermelon')                  # Also Push
Fruits=( "${Fruits[@]/Ap*/}" )          # Remove by regex match
unset Fruits[2]                         # Remove one item
Fruits=("${Fruits[@]}")                 # Duplicate
Fruits=("${Fruits[@]}" "${Veggies[@]}") # Concatenate
lines=(`cat "logfile"`)                 # Read from file
```

### Iteration

```bash
for i in "${arrayName[@]}"; do
  echo "$i"
done
```

## Dictionaries

{: .-three-column}

### Defining

```bash
declare -A sounds
```

```bash
sounds[dog]="bark"
sounds[cow]="moo"
sounds[bird]="tweet"
sounds[wolf]="howl"
```

Declares `sound` as a Dictionary object (aka associative array).

### Working with dictionaries

```bash
echo "${sounds[dog]}" # Dog's sound
echo "${sounds[@]}"   # All values
echo "${!sounds[@]}"  # All keys
echo "${#sounds[@]}"  # Number of elements
unset sounds[dog]     # Delete dog
```

### Iteration

#### Iterate over values

```bash
for val in "${sounds[@]}"; do
  echo "$val"
done
```

#### Iterate over keys

```bash
for key in "${!sounds[@]}"; do
  echo "$key"
done
```

## Options

### Options

```bash
set -o noclobber  # Avoid overlay files (echo "hi" > foo)
set -o errexit    # Used to exit upon error, avoiding cascading errors
set -o pipefail   # Unveils hidden failures
set -o nounset    # Exposes unset variables
```

### Glob options

```bash
shopt -s nullglob    # Non-matching globs are removed  ('*.foo' => '')
shopt -s failglob    # Non-matching globs throw errors
shopt -s nocaseglob  # Case insensitive globs
shopt -s dotglob     # Wildcards match dotfiles ("*.sh" => ".foo.sh")
shopt -s globstar    # Allow ** for recursive matches ('lib/**/*.rb' => 'lib/a/b/c.rb')
```

Set `GLOBIGNORE` as a colon-separated list of patterns to be removed from glob
matches.

### Getting options

```bash
while [[ "$1" =~ ^- && ! "$1" == "--" ]]; do case $1 in
  -V | --version )
    echo "$version"
    exit
    ;;
  -s | --string )
    shift; string=$1
    ;;
  -f | --flag )
    flag=1
    ;;
esac; shift; done
if [[ "$1" == '--' ]]; then shift; fi
```

### Heredoc

```sh
cat <<END
hello world
END
```

### Reading input

```bash
echo -n "Proceed? [y/n]: "
read -r ans
echo "$ans"
```

The `-r` option disables a peculiar legacy behavior with backslashes.

```bash
read -n 1 ans    # Just one character
```

### Special variables

read -p "prompt" <varname> # same as above but outputs a prompt to ask user for value
column -t <filename> # display info in pretty columns (often used with pipe)
let <varname> = <equation> # performs mathematical calculation using operators like +, -, \*, /, %
export VARNAME=value # defines an environment variable (will be available in subprocesses)
export -f <funcname> # Exports function 'funcname'
export var1="var1 value" # Export and assign in the same statement
export <varname> # Copy Bash variable
declare -x <varname> # Copy Bash variable
```

```bash
array[0]=valA # how to define an array
array[1]=valB
array[2]=valC
array=([2]=valC [0]=valA [1]=valB) # another way
array=(valA valB valC) # and another

${array[i]}                  # displays array's value for this index. If no index is supplied, array element 0 is assumed
${#array[i]} # to find out the length of any element in the array
${#array[@]} # to find out how many values there are in the array
```

```bash
declare -a # the variables are treated as arrays
declare -f # uses function names only
declare -F # displays function names without definitions
declare -i # the variables are treated as integers
declare -r # makes the variables read-only
declare -x # marks the variables for export via the environment
declare -l # uppercase values in the variable are converted to lowercase
declare -A # makes it an associative array
```

```bash
${varname:-word}             # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise return word
${varname:word} # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise return word
${varname:=word}             # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise set it word and then return its value
${varname:?message} # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise print varname, followed by message and abort the current command or script
${varname:+word}             # if varname exists and isn't null, return word; otherwise return null
${varname:offset:length} # performs substring expansion. It returns the substring of $varname starting at offset and up to length characters

${variable#pattern}          # if the pattern matches the beginning of the variable's value, delete the shortest part that matches and return the rest
${variable##pattern} # if the pattern matches the beginning of the variable's value, delete the longest part that matches and return the rest
${variable%pattern}          # if the pattern matches the end of the variable's value, delete the shortest part that matches and return the rest
${variable%%pattern} # if the pattern matches the end of the variable's value, delete the longest part that matches and return the rest
${variable/pattern/string}   # the longest match to pattern in variable is replaced by string. Only the first match is replaced
${variable//pattern/string} # the longest match to pattern in variable is replaced by string. All matches are replaced

${#varname} # returns the length of the value of the variable as a character string
```

```bash
\*(patternlist) # matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns
+(patternlist) # matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns
?(patternlist) # matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns
@(patternlist) # matches exactly one of the given patterns
!(patternlist) # matches anything except one of the given patterns
```

```bash
$(UNIX command) # command substitution: runs the command and returns standard output
typeset -l <x> # makes variable local - <x> must be an interger
```

### FUNCTIONS

#### The function refers to passed arguments by position (as if they were positional parameters), that is, $1, $2, and so forth.

$@ is equal to "$1" "$2"... "$N", where N is the number of positional parameters. $# holds the number of positional parameters.

```bash
function functname() {
shell commands
}

unset -f functname # deletes a function definition
declare -f # displays all defined functions in your login session
```

### FLOW CONTROLS

```bash
statement1 && statement2 # and operator
statement1 || statement2 # or operator

-a # and operator inside a test conditional expression
-o # or operator inside a test conditional expression
```

#### STRINGS

```bash
str1 == str2 # str1 matches str2
str1 != str2 # str1 does not match str2
str1 < str2 # str1 is less than str2 (alphabetically)
str1 > str2 # str1 is greater than str2 (alphabetically)
str1 \> str2 # str1 is sorted after str2
str1 \< str2 # str1 is sorted before str2
-n str1 # str1 is not null (has length greater than 0)
-z str1 # str1 is null (has length 0)
```

#### FILES

```bash
-a file # file exists or its compilation is successful
-d file # file exists and is a directory
-e file # file exists; same -a
-f file # file exists and is a regular file (i.e., not a directory or other special type of file)
-r file # you have read permission
-s file # file exists and is not empty
-w file # your have write permission
-x file # you have execute permission on file, or directory search permission if it is a directory
-N file # file was modified since it was last read
-O file # you own file
-G file # file's group ID matches yours (or one of yours, if you are in multiple groups)
file1 -nt file2 # file1 is newer than file2
file1 -ot file2 # file1 is older than file2
```

#### NUMBERS

```bash
-lt # less than
-le # less than or equal
-eq # equal
-ge # greater than or equal
-gt # greater than
-ne # not equal
```

**_Conditional_**

```bash
if condition
then
statements
[elif condition
then statements...]
[else
statements]
fi
```

**_Loops_**

```bash
for x in {1..10}
do
statements
done
```

```bash
for name [in list]
do
statements that can use $name
done
```

```bash
for (( initialisation ; ending condition ; update ))
do
statements...
done
```

```bash
case expression in
pattern1
statements ;;
pattern2
statements ;;
esac
```

```bash
select name [in list]
do
statements that can use $name
done
```

```bash
while condition; do
statements
done
```

```bash
until condition; do
statements
done
```

### COMMAND-LINE PROCESSING CYCLE

#### The default order for command lookup is functions, followed by built-ins, with scripts and executables last.

There are three built-ins that you can use to override this order: `command`, `builtin` and `enable`.

```bash
command # removes alias and function lookup. Only built-ins and commands found in the search path are executed
builtin # looks up only built-in commands, ignoring functions and commands found in PATH
enable # enables and disables shell built-ins
eval # takes arguments and run them through the command-line processing steps all over again
exec # replaces the current shell with the given command
exit # terminates the shell process
```

#### INPUT/OUTPUT REDIRECTORS

#### cmd1|cmd2 # pipe; takes standard output of cmd1 as standard input to cmd2

```bash
< file # takes standard input from file

> file # directs standard output to file
>
> > file # directs standard output to file; append to file if it already exists
> > |file # forces standard output to file even if noclobber is set
> > n>|file # forces output to file from file descriptor n even if noclobber is set
> > <> file # uses file as both standard input and standard output
> > n<>file # uses file as both input and output for file descriptor n
> > n>file # directs file descriptor n to file
> > n<file # takes file descriptor n from file
> > n>>file # directs file description n to file; append to file if it already exists
> > n>& # duplicates standard output to file descriptor n
> > n<& # duplicates standard input from file descriptor n
> > n>&m # file descriptor n is made to be a copy of the output file descriptor
> > n<&m # file descriptor n is made to be a copy of the input file descriptor
> > &>file # directs standard output and standard error to file
> > <&- # closes the standard input
> > &- # closes the standard output
> > n>&- # closes the ouput from file descriptor n
> > n<&- # closes the input from file descriptor n

|tee <file># output command to both terminal and a file (-a to append to file)
```

### PROCESS HANDLING

To suspend a job, type CTRL+Z while it is running. You can also suspend a job with CTRL+Y.
This is slightly different from CTRL+Z in that the process is only stopped when it attempts to read input from terminal.
Of course, to interrupt a job, type CTRL+C.

-myCommand & # runs job in the background and prompts back the shell-
jobs # lists all jobs (use with -l to see associated PID)

```bash
fg # brings a background job into the foreground
fg %+ # brings most recently invoked background job
fg %- # brings second most recently invoked background job
fg %N # brings job number N
fg %string # brings job whose command begins with string
fg %?string # brings job whose command contains string
```

```bash
kill -l # returns a list of all signals on the system, by name and number
kill PID # terminates process with specified PID
kill -s SIGKILL 4500 # sends a signal to force or terminate the process
kill -15 913 # Ending PID 913 process with signal 15 (TERM)
kill %1 # Where %1 is the number of job as read from 'jobs' command.
```

```bash
ps # prints a line of information about the current running login shell and any processes running under it
ps -a # selects all processes with a tty except session leaders
```

```bash
trap cmd sig1 sig2 # executes a command when a signal is received by the script
trap "" sig1 sig2 # ignores that signals
trap - sig1 sig2 # resets the action taken when the signal is received to the default
```

```bash
disown <PID|JID> # removes the process from the list of jobs
wait # waits until all background jobs have finished
sleep <number> # wait # of seconds before continuing
```

```bash
pv # display progress bar for data handling commands. often used with pipe like |pv
yes # give yes response everytime an input is requested from script/process
```

### TIPS & TRICKS

#### set an alias

```bash
cd; nano .bash_profile

> alias gentlenode='ssh admin@gentlenode.com -p 3404' # add your alias in .bash_profile
```

#### to quickly go to a specific directory

```bash
cd; nano .bashrc

> shopt -s cdable_vars
> export websites="/Users/mac/Documents/websites"

source .bashrc
cd $websites
```

### DEBUGGING SHELL PROGRAMS

```bash
bash -n scriptname # don't run commands; check for syntax errors only
set -o noexec # alternative (set option in script)

bash -v scriptname # echo commands before running them
set -o verbose # alternative (set option in script)

bash -x scriptname # echo commands after command-line processing
set -o xtrace # alternative (set option in script)

trap 'echo $varname' EXIT # useful when you want to print out the values of variables at the point that your script exits

function errtrap {
es=$?
echo "ERROR line $1: Command exited with status $es."
}

trap 'errtrap $LINENO' ERR # is run whenever a command in the surrounding script or function exits with non-zero status

function dbgtrap {
echo "badvar is $badvar"
}

trap dbgtrap DEBUG # causes the trap code to be executed before every statement in a function or script

# ...section of code in which the problem occurs...

trap - DEBUG # turn off the DEBUG trap

function returntrap {
echo "A return occurred"
}

trap returntrap RETURN # is executed each time a shell function or a script executed with the . or source commands finishes executing
```
